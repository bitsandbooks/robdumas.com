            <p>Chicago Public Library launched its Maker Lab in July of 2013 and I'm one of the lucky few who works there! We teach people to design and create using our 3D printers, lasers (for cutting and etching) and vinyl cutters. We have classes on knitting, flower arranging, Arduino and Raspberry Pi programming and more!</p>
            <p>It's an absolute <em>blast</em> working there and I always learn as much as I teach. It's incredible to see the look on someone's face when you show them how to turn their idea into a real-world object. In fact, the Maker Lab has been so successful that it won a 2013 Chicago Innovation Award for Social Innovation.</p>

            <p>iCPL is an app I'm working on, mostly to teach myself how to write iOS apps using the Cocoa Touch framework. It's fairly simple right now, but it is working. Keep your eyes on the App Store!</p>

            <h3>Rout-O-Matic</h3>
            <p>When I started in my current position, I was surprised to discover that the staff was printing out our daily router (a list of books requested by other branches) and separating them by subject by cutting the sheets up with scissors. We don't have any development tools on our staff computers, so the only app on the computers that could generate such a report was… Microsoft Access. (<em>I know, I know.</em>) In just a few days, I put together a tool using Access which allowed the staff to print off subject-oriented router reports that were a lot easier on the eyes… and didn't require a pair of scissors to split up.</p>
            <p>The Rout-O-Matic isn't pretty, but it gets the job done and it's become a valued tool at my library. My co-workers use it every day and there's no way they're going back to the old way of splitting up the router. The lesson I've learned from building the Rout-O-Matic is that while it's important to aim high, it's even more important to actually get a working tool into users' hands.</p>
            <p>Or, as Steve Jobs once said: <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RealArtistsShip" title="Real Artists Ship">“Real artists ship.”</a></p>

            <h3>Git in 5 Minutes</h3>
            <p>This is a shorter, "lightning talk" version of my previous talk. I gave this talk at the <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2013" title="Code4Lib 2013">Code4Lib conference</a> in February 2013. Although there was a great deal from the earlier presentation which I had to cut out – lightning talks can only be 5 minutes long – I'm actually quite pleased with how it turned out. I got a lot of positive feedback from it, as well. You can also follow along with <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bitsandbooks/git-in-5-minutes">the slides for this talk</a>.</p>

            <h3>Helpful Hints for Job Searchers</h3>
            <p>My <em>Helpful Hints for Job Searchers</em> packet started out as a little one-page sheet with a few tips I wrote up and gave to patrons when they came into the library asking about finding a job when the economy was falling apart in late 2008. More than four years later, it's still popular with patrons and has been expanded into something really amazing.</p>
            <p>The <em>Helpful Hints</em> became so popular that in 2010, parts of it were used to rewrite the <a href="http://www.chipublib.org/cplbooksmovies/espfor/job_searchers/js_index.php" title="Especially for Job Searchers at Chicago Public Library">Especially for Job Searchers</a> section of CPL's web site. It's by far the largest, most sustained impact I've been able to affect upon the system and the populace and I'm still immensely proud of it.</p>
